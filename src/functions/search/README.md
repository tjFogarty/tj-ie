## netlify-plugin-search-index function

This is a serverless Netlify Function generated by [netlify-plugin-search-index](https://github.com/sw-yx/netlify-plugin-search-index).

You can use the generated function that reads the JSON and returns fuzzy search results to be lighter on your frontend. The generated function is available at `.netlify/functions/search` and you can use it with a search term like `.netlify/functions/search?s=foo` or `.netlify/functions/search?search=foo`:

    ```js
    // app.js
    document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', async event => {
      const result = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/search?search=${event.target.searchText.value}`).then(x => x.json())
      document.getElementById('result').innerText = JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)
    })
    ```

Under the hood, the search function uses [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) and in future we may expose more configurations for this.

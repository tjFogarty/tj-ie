I often find myself browsing plugins for Craft, and wanted a little resource where I could do just that searching a name, or sorting by downloads and GitHub stars.

It's built with Vue, and uses the {% external-link "https://packagist.org/apidoc", "Packagist API" %}.

You can {% external-link "https://github.com/tjFogarty/craft-plugins", "browse the source" %}, or {% external-link "https://codepen.io/tjFogarty/project/full/ZdYLPK/", "see the demo" %}.

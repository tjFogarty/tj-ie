We may be familiar with the formable `border` property, which has been used for many a year for {% external-link "http://cssarrowplease.com/", "generating arrows" %} to add a little bit of pizazz to our pages.

I only recently got a chance to play with the `clip-path` property to take these flourishes to a new, scalable level.

Of course, ambitions for technology like this can scale far beyond the example above, as seen by this fantastic resource called {% external-link "http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/", "Clippy" %}.

This is only a brief example of what's possible, and I'm looking forward to exploring this more on upcoming projects. Check out {% external-link "https://css-tricks.com/clipping-masking-css/", "Clipping and Masking in CSS" %} for far more exciting examples.

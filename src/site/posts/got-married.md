Two weeks ago, myself and Sarah got married. One of the best days of my life. After over a year of planning, the day went perfect. We were even graced with some stunning weather.

I'm still in recovery mode if I'm being honest, but it was such good craic from what I can remember. Everything just flew by so quickly, and it was all so surreal that it's hard to take it all in on the day. So we'll have to wait for the photos and video to come back to help piece it all together.

Oh, and of course we had to incorporate the cats somehow:

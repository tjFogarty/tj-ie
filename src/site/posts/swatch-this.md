I built a tool to analyse and extract interesting colours from images. I'll write more about it later, but it'll give you primary, secondary and accent colours.

Here's an example:

<img src="/assets/images/swatch-this.png" alt="An example colour palette generated from an image." />

It talks to Claude to do this, and images aren't kept.

Check it out! [Swatch This](https://swatch.tj.ie).

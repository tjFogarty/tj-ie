The previous version of my site was ok. I never found it exciting to look at, and sometimes, that's what you need as motivation to work on and improve it.

That changed yesterday with a fresh coat of paint.

The site itself is still built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), and I'm delighted with the experience of using it. I'm also looking to keep all this portable to migrate the site at the drop of a hat if required.

The goal with the previous version was to give [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) a genuine and honest go. It did the job, but I felt disconnected from the styling process. I prefer writing CSS and organising files in a way that makes sense. I structure it how it lives in my head.

The [source of the site is available to browse](https://github.com/tjFogarty/tj-ie) and is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

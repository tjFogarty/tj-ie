Recently, I was contacted by the folks at Skillshare to create a class. I've never done videos before, and really dislike hearing my own voice, but I was interested in giving it a go.

They were very helpful in getting me set up, and even did some editing work to tidy up the final result.

In the video I walk through creating an RSS feed reader with Vue.js, and Netlify using their functions feature to deploy to AWS Lambda to fetch the feeds. Have a go if you're interested and give me a shout if there's any questions!

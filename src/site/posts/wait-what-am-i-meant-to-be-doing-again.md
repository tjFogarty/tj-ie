I’m not primarily a JavaScript Developer - I’m more used to Front-end Development and the tooling scene that has grown with it. Coupled with that I’ve been building websites using WordPress and, for the past 7 months, ExpressionEngine.

Skills on the web atrophy quite quickly, so I’ve been spending some spare time touching up on what I think will be relevant in the years to come. It’s a requirement of the trade, really, otherwise you run the risk of using the modern-day equivalent of table-based layouts.

This can be frustrating as you have to be willing to throw out what you spent all those months, or even years, learning, but it’s also a fantastic opportunity.

I’ve been shying away from JavaScript because it’s a mental block for me. Here’s my process:

“Angular looks really cool, I’ll have a play around with it.”

- `bower install` that shit.
- Mess with some boilerplate to build a controller.
- Marvel at the wonder of data-binding.
- I’m a rockstar, this is easy.
- What’s a service?
- What’s a factory?
- When should I use one or the other? Or at all?
- I’m out.

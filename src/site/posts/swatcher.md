I've been working on this project for over a month now, and it’s taken some twists and turns.

Initially, it was for generating colour palettes using prompts or images. This expanded into more specific prompts, including interiors.

From there, things became very paint-focused. You can choose any colour you like and find a matching paint colour. These starter colours can come from your camera, a generated palette, or another paint colour.

You can favourite colours and create collections. I imagined collections to be made up of all the colours you find for a specific project, like a bedroom refresh, but you could also have different collections for different hues. It’s whatever you want it to be.

The paints available are mostly Ireland-specific, as I’m sharing the application with friends and family in the hope it might be helpful to them.

I think this is the first proper application I’ve released into the wild. I’m delighted with it, and it’s enjoyable to work on when I have time, either at night or on weekends. Keeps me out of trouble.

A couple of years I ago I struggled with finding a timeline component for Vue. Since then I've gone on to implement 3rd party solutions and even writing one for a company I worked for.

What I'm working on now, though, is an implementation quite different to the above. It's a simple use case: a list of resources with events attached.
This needs to live on an infinite scroll timeline, and it must be performance-focused.

With that, you can check out the below links. It's a very early work in progress.

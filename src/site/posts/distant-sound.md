I had a small idea for a demo based on sound, with the idea that the further you scroll from it, the quieter it gets.

It was interesting to think about pieces of a page as having a place and area of influence. What if you had multiple sounds on a page, and as you move these sounds fade in/out and mix? It would be like traversing a museum, perhaps, as you dip in and out of what's going on around you, catching glimpses of insight and adjusting to the new feel of your surroundings as they change.

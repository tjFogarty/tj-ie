I recently put together an app for my wife, who had the idea of collecting the recipes she finds in one place, and making it easy to set up meal plans and shopping lists so we can plan our week.

The idea is simple enough, but it's a powerful tool for us. We can paste in a recipe video, it'll transcribe it and merge with the caption to create a recipe - ingredients and instructions. Alternatively, we can paste in a web page URL and it'll pull the recipe information out.

With all your recipes, you can create a shopping list from them, and also a meal plan for your desired date ranges. You can have it randomly select meals as well to reduce effort.

I’ve also added a feature to search Irish stores for ingredients so you can set your budget.

It’s built with Laravel and hosted on Laravel Cloud. I haven’t used Laravel in a while, so I wanted to check it out, and it’s all been going pretty smoothly!

I’m enjoying having the energy in my spare time to work on stuff like this. Keeps the mind sharp. Or as sharp as mine can be.

My family and friends are back in Limerick, so I make trips there when possible. Usually, I make tracks early Saturday morning. I'll take a pit stop in Mooncoin to get something to drink and another one in Tipperary before making the final leg of the journey to Limerick.

The trip takes anywhere from two to two-and-a-half hours, depending on traffic. I enjoy the drive since I get to blast some music. Lately, it's Periphery, one of my favourite bands. What I like about the drive as well is that it's interesting. You're mostly passing through small towns or villages, and the views of the trees in the hills can be stunning.

I might see some friends on Saturday or hang out with the family. Once Sunday afternoon comes around, I'm back on the road again.

Here's Mac; he's a mix of a Maltese and a Bichon Freise. My parents have two dogs; the other is Marvel, a Bishon Freise.

I'll be back up for Christmas and stay a few days. In the meantime, I'll leave you with a tune I've been jamming on recent trips.

The past year or so has been a flurry of text-editor switching. Sublime, now Atom, and Sublime again, wait now I'm using PHPStorm, back to Sublime...

It's a wonder how I get any work done, but I'm finally settling down with Atom, so I thought I'd list out some of the packages I'm using. I won't list themes, because those changes are far more frenetic.

It's worth noting that Sublime Text also has equivalent packages.

## [SFTP-Deployment](https://atom.io/packages/SFTP-deployment)

> Spend less time managing file transfers and more time coding. FTP and SFTP support for Atom.io to send and receive files directly in your server.

The usefulness speaks for itself when working on a dev server where you just need to rapidly fire files up online.

## [File Icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)

> Adds file specific icons to atom for improved visual grepping. Works with Tree View and Fuzzy Finder and Tabs.

## [Git-Plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus)

I'm used to the command line, or using Tower. For more common actions, this package does wonderfully.

> vim-fugitive like package for atom. make commits and other git things without the terminal

## [JSHint](https://atom.io/packages/jshint)

Just some straight-up linting goodness.

## [Merge Conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts)

Does exactly what it says on the tin.

## [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)

I've grown so used to seeing this in Sublime that the editor feels empty without it.

## [PHP fmt](https://atom.io/packages/php-fmt)

This is only a recent addition for me, but I've grown quite fond already.

## [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)

Pure beauty. Displays colours in your project files. Install and check out your colour variables and gaze for hours.

## [Sync Settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings)

> Synchronize settings, keymaps, user styles, init script, snippets and installed packages across Atom instances.

[Gary](https://twitter.com/BashfulMonk) pointed this out to me, and it became essential immediately.

## [Zen Tabs](https://atom.io/packages/zentabs)

> Keep your opened tabs below a maximum limit, closing the oldest one first.

I can get overwhelmed by many tabs, to the point where they're no longer useful. This greatly improves that.

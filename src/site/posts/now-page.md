I’ve recently added a “Now” page to this site. It’s a fun little part of the site that adds a bit more personality, but I also think it’s a way to keep me accountable and finish more things.

Stuff like learning guitar, getting in shape, and reading more.

There’s a section for the weather, and what I’m currently listening to. I started by going with an existing API approach, but experimenting with keys and authentication to try to pull this info in was sucking the life out of me. The information exists on public pages, so why not crawl them and extract the data?

That’s it anyway.

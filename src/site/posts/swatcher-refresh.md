It seems I'm changing things every day on [Swatcher](https://swatcher.ie). I'm terrible for tinkering, but it's a project I'm having great fun with.

I'm happy with the main app area, which feels like a pretty typical app style. You have a sidebar and content.

The homepage is something I struggle a bit more with, and originally it was far more complicated. I was listing all the details I could to get across all the functionality it offers. It got to a point where I wanted to step back. Rather than overload someone with information, I decided to simplify it, and bake some actual features that people can use onto the page.

Here's what you were first greeted with before:

So now we have something far simpler, but also a bit more inviting. I hope. You can see a live view of trending paint colours, and dive into paint exploration by picking a colour right on the homepage.

Come back next week when it changes again. I'm feeling better about this approach, though, so it might hang around a while longer.

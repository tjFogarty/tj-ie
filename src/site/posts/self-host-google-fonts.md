A tool I use a lot is [Google Webfonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts). I download the fonts and host them myself, which I kinda like cause I have more control over the files. Part of my webpack setup involves creating a service worker, so it's minimal effort to add them in there.

I was doing this before Google allowed you to use `font-display`, so there was that advantage for a while.

I can use `rel="preload"` as well to help speed things up:

``` html
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/pt-sans-v10-latin-regular.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/pt-serif-v10-latin-700.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/pt-serif-v10-latin-regular.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
```

10/10 from me. [You can see the source and contribute on GitHub.](https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper)

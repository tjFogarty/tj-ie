Iâ€™m TJ, a web develÂ­opÂ­er from {% external-link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick", "LimÂ­erÂ­ick, IreÂ­land" %} ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª and livÂ­ing in WaterÂ­ford. I have a BSc Hons in Multimedia Programming, and Design from the Limerick Institute of Technology.

I've been around a while (over 10 years now), and I've had the chance to work at some great places:

- Senior Software Engineer at {% external-link "https://www.workhuman.com/", "Workhuman" %} (current)
- Senior Software Engingeer at {% external-link "https://www.teamwork.com/", "Teamwork" %}
- UI Engineer at {% external-link "https://stitcherads.com/", "StitcherAds" %} 
- Technical Lead at {% external-link "https://emagine.ie/", "EmagÂ­ine" %}
- Lead Developer at {% external-link "https://www.maverick-intl.com/", "MavÂ­erÂ­ick" %}

I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing clients including The President of Ireland, a number of Universities & third-level colleges, and countless local, national, and international businesses.

I mostly post to my blog, but here's a couple of other things I've worked on:

- CSS-Tricks article: {% external-link "https://css-tricks.com/timber-and-twig-reignited-my-love-for-wordpress/", "TimÂ­ber and Twig ReignitÂ­ed my Love for WordÂ­Press" %}
- Free Skillshare course: {% external-link "https://skl.sh/3eVc2WY", "Create an RSS Feed Reader with Node and Vue.js" %}

Iâ€™m TJ, a web develÂ­opÂ­er from [LimÂ­erÂ­ick, IreÂ­land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª and livÂ­ing in WaterÂ­ford. I have a BSc Hons in Multimedia Programming, and Design from the Limerick Institute of Technology.

I've been around a while (over 10 years now), and I've had the chance to work at some great places:

- Senior Software Engineer at [Workhuman](https://www.workhuman.com/) (current)
- Senior Software Engineer at [Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com/)
- UI Engineer at [StitcherAds](https://stitcherads.com/)
- Technical Lead at [Emagine](https://emagine.ie/)
- Lead Developer at [Maverick](https://www.maverick-intl.com/)

I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing clients including The President of Ireland, a number of Universities & third-level colleges, and countless local, national, and international businesses.

I mostly post to my blog, but here's a couple of other things I've worked on:

- CSS-Tricks article: [TimÂ­ber and Twig ReignitÂ­ed my Love for WordÂ­Press](https://css-tricks.com/timber-and-twig-reignited-my-love-for-wordpress/)
- Free Skillshare course: [Create an RSS Feed Reader with Node and Vue.js](https://skl.sh/3eVc2WY)

Lenore is a recent addition to our family here alongside Ares and Loki. We found her in some hedges a few weeks ago, and after some careful introductions, she had the house taken over. Our other two sometimes don't know what to do with her, but they're getting along well. She's as cracked as they are, so they'll be best pals I'm sure.

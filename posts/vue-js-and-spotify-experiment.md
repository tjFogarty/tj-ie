**Note: This no longers works after Spotify updated their API, I do apologise.**

This is a small experiment for me to try and put together what I&#8217;ve learned when working with Vue.js.

I could be doing this all wrong with Vue, but I had fun doing it. Onwards and upwards!

I&#8217;m useless when it comes to design, so I took ideas from {% external-link "http://www.materialup.com/posts/music-player-transition", "Music Player Transition" %}. Code for interacting with Spotify from {% external-link "http://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/0u0v7e1b/", "here" %}.

Check out the repo {% external-link "https://github.com/tjFogarty/vue-spotify-preview", "here" %}.
